# 📆 GitHub Daily Commit Pinger

> ⚡ This repo keeps my GitHub contribution graph active by logging a timestamp every day using GitHub Actions.

---

## 🔧 How It Works

- A GitHub Action runs **daily at midnight UTC**
- It appends a log entry to `activity.log` with the current date/time
- This creates a real commit so that the contribution graph stays green ✅

---

## 🛡️ Disclaimer

This project is purely for educational and personal learning purposes.  
All commits are generated by an automated GitHub Action that performs real file updates.

---

## 📁 Files

- `activity.log`: Stores a timestamp for each daily run
- `.github/workflows/daily-ping.yml`: GitHub Action workflow file

---

## 🧠 Why?

I use this to:
- Practice automation with GitHub Actions
- Maintain a consistent commit streak for motivation
- Learn about GitHub workflows and scheduling
