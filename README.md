# 🔄 Activity Pinger

A GitHub Action that helps keep your contribution graph green 🌱 by committing daily to this repo automatically.

---

## 📌 What It Does

This repo uses a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/daily-commit.yml`) that:

- Runs **automatically every day** at midnight (00:00 UTC)
- Commits a tiny change (like updating the date in a file)
- Keeps your GitHub activity graph active without needing manual work

Perfect for:
- 📈 Keeping your green squares consistent
- 🔄 Showcasing automation and workflow skills
- 💼 Maintaining a healthy-looking profile even during breaks

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

- The workflow is triggered by a `cron` job (`0 0 * * *`)
- It updates a hidden file to simulate activity
- Commits are made using your GitHub bot identity

> 🧠 This repository uses a GitHub Actions workflow to automate daily commits.  
> The purpose is to explore DevOps automation, GitHub Actions, and cron jobs — not to fake contribution activity.  
> All commits are generated by a scheduled workflow and clearly marked as such.
