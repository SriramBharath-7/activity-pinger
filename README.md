# 📆 GitHub Daily Commit Pinger

> ⚡ Keep your contribution graph alive with automated daily commits using GitHub Actions!

---

## 🔧 How It Works

- A GitHub Action runs **daily at midnight UTC**
- It appends a log entry to `activity.log` with the current date and time
- This creates a real commit, keeping your contribution graph green ✅

---

## 📁 Files

- `activity.log` – Stores a timestamp for each daily run
- `.github/workflows/daily-ping.yml` – GitHub Actions workflow file

---

## 🧠 Why This Repo?

I use this project to:

- 🛠️ Practice automation with GitHub Actions  
- 🧩 Maintain a consistent commit streak for motivation  
- 🚀 Explore scheduled workflows and YAML scripting

---

## 🛡️ Disclaimer

This repo is created purely for **educational and learning** purposes.  
All commits are generated by a GitHub Action that updates a file and pushes a valid commit.
